# Soc2025

Before starting this course, my only programming experience was with C++ through CS101. I didn’t even know how to print a simple statement in Python. In Week 1, I began learning the basics of Python—its syntax, variables, loops, and functions. Unfortunately, in Week 2, I had to attend a family function, and soon after, I caught a fever, which forced me to pause my learning. I was able to restart from the middle of Week 3 with a fresh mindset.

Once I got back on track, I gradually picked up momentum. I started with Pandas, learning how to manipulate and analyze data using DataFrames and Series. After that, I moved on to NumPy, where I understood how powerful arrays and vectorized operations can be for numerical computing. Then I explored Matplotlib, which helped me visualize data through various types of plots and charts. Most recently, I’ve been working with Seaborn, which makes data visualization even more informative and aesthetically pleasing.

 I am currently about a week behind the schedule. Moreover, I’ve noticed that the upcoming topics are significantly more challenging and will require additional time and focus. If the SoC deadline could be extended to the first week of August, it would really help me complete the course comfortably and with a deeper understanding.
